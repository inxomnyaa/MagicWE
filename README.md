# MagicWEv2 - Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger [![Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci.badge/thebigsmileXD/MagicWE2/MagicWE2/master)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/thebigsmileXD/MagicWE2) 
The new MagicWE, now way more powerful, with more support, more commands, new tools and more!

# What's new?
Literally everything.

The code is totally different to the MESS of MagicWEv1 - MagicWEv2 has a new fresh coating over the full plugin, with rainbow colored sprinkle topping.

Who does *NOT* love rainbow sprinkles? Freak!

- An icon
- New commands
- New features
- Translations
- ***EXTREME*** speed
- progress bars like on Windows 98!
- sessions
- clipboards
- schematic support
- MyPlot support

## Commands
- //wand - now gives a proper wand tool which never stops working, and still allows your normal wooden axes to behave normal

<!-- 
- //brush - brushes that can be configured via user interface - select whatever you want and receive your brush tool!
-->

- //copy - Copy and Paste anything! Copied areas are saved in clipboards, which can be modified afterwards, cloned from other players, cached and reloaded!

- //paste - Paste your clipboard - now with flags! (See below)

- //pos1, //1, //pos2, //2 - shorter aliases for lazy people! Wohoo, that includes me!

- //set, //fill, //afill - Block parsing has be ***hyperoptimized*** - you can place any block, by id, name, and item!
Also, there are flags for keeping existing blocks, replacing only existing blocks, hollow set commands etc.. Did i mention that is a ton faster than on MagicWEv1? And asynchronous? And ***awesome***?

- //replace - replaces certain blocks within the selection (for example, dirt) with another block (for example, grass). 

- //help, //? - Well, not really.. It is being worked on though!
